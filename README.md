# Bird-Call-Identifier

This project takes a bird call dataset from the "" species and generates a model that will identify the bird call in an audio clip.

Technologies & Languages used:

- Python
- Tensor Flow

It will convert a waveform into a spectogram so that we can ustilize computer vision techniques(convolutional neural netowrks) to prefrom classification
